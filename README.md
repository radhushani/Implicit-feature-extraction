# A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF FEATURE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES FOR MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFICATION OF IMPLICIT FEATURES IN RESTAURANT REVIEWS

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase for conducting research on Implicit Aspect Sentiment Analysis in restaurant reviews. The research investigates three main approaches for extracting implicit features from textual data:

1. **TF-IDF Vectorization and Machine Learning (ML) Approach**
   - Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization combined with traditional machine learning classifiers such as Logistic Regression and SVM.
   
2. **DistilBERT Embeddings and ML Approach**
   - Employs DistilBERT embeddings to capture contextual information from reviews, integrated with machine learning classifiers.

3. **Fine-Tuning DistilBERT Model and Its Embeddings with ML Approach**
   - Fine-tunes the pre-trained DistilBERT model specifically for the task of implicit aspect sentiment analysis, leveraging its powerful language representation capabilities.

The research aims to evaluate the performance of these approaches using established metrics such as ROC-AUC, Hamming Loss, and F1 Score. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, the goal is to provide insights into the effectiveness and limitations of each methodology, contributing to advancements in sentiment analysis techniques for restaurant reviews.
